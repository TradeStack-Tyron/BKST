Okay, I am building out a web application using React (typescript) as my frontend, fastapi for my backend, postgres as my database and render as the site I will use for deployment. BSKT, the name of my site, is a web app designed to help day traders make better trades, all for free. the site will accomplish this by providing a space where trader can backtest their strategies using historical candlestick data from the twelve data API(the graphs will be pulled from the lightweight chart library). On BSKT, users will be able to create a account. Once an account is created, they will be able to create a session. When creating a session, they will be asked to pick an old date of time that they would like to start the simulation from and the date they want to end the simulation. users can also pick the amount of capital that the session will start with. at the end of the session, users will see the the total amount of money they won lor lost. As stretch features, users will have access to a ai chatbot that they can ask trading related questions. In similarity with tradingviews chart and tools, BSKT will also have a few of the chart tools that tradigview has.
